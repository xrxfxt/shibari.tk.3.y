## [TK (Y-3TK) Gote Shibari - TheDuchy](https://www.theduchy.com/gote-shibari/#y-3tk)

There are 3 options (Y-3TK, X-3TK, Mt Fuji 3TK) for adding more stability,
security and artistry by adding a 3rd rope. These techniques can also be used
to “use up” rope that you may have left over from your 2TK.

<img src="assets/3TK-Y-Harness-03.jpg" title="3. You have several options on how to make the front look. Option 1 is like the Bikini Harness. Option 2 is like the Shinju." />
<img src="assets/3TK-Y-Harness-04.jpg" title="4. (Option 1 – Bikini Harness Style) Lay the tail over top of both straps" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Y-Harness-05.jpg" title="5. Reach under the lower strap, placing your fingers on the *same side* of the tail as the shoulder the tail just came over" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Y-Harness-06.jpg" title="6. Reach under the upper strap, placing your fingers on the *same side* of the tail as the shoulder the tail just came over" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Y-Harness-07.jpg" title="7. Like this" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Y-Harness-08.jpg" title="8. Pull the tail through. The cords of the lower strap may deform slightly. Many riggers flatten them again, many do not. I have not done so in this tutorial" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Y-Harness-09.jpg" title="9. Run over the other shoulder. Skip to Step 15 to tie off." />
<img src="assets/3TK-Y-Harness-10.jpg" title="10. (Option 2 – Shinju Style) Run the tail through itself below the top strap instead of above" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Y-Harness-11.jpg" title="11. Grab the tail" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Y-Harness-12.jpg" title="12. Pull it through and over the other shoulder. Alternatively…" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Y-Harness-13.jpg" title="13. …you can add and extra twist if you like…" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Y-Harness-14.jpg" title="14. Then run the tail over the other shoulder" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Y-Harness-15.jpg" title="15. Run the tail behind the upper strap and then tie the tail off to the center line or the strap on the opposite side. The next few steps show one way of doing so (many other ways are also just fine…)" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Y-Harness-16.jpg" title="16. I have a quite a bit of rope left, so I will go under the lower strap as well" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Y-Harness-17.jpg" title="17. Pull the tail through" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Y-Harness-18.jpg" title="18. Go across the center line" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Y-Harness-19.jpg" title="19. The lock it off with a half hitch or two" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Y-Harness-20.jpg" title="20. If you have a lot of rope left, you can use it up in a variety of ways. You can run the rope around the soft part of the belly, then tie it off back on the center line Or you could wind the rope around the straps Or you could make a series of Crossing Hitches around the back like in a classic 3TK (or “X-3TK” as shown below)…" />
